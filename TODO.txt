==== gameplan ====

- in install_symlink(), change the -l section to check if it's pointing to OUR OWN repo, and only
  overwrite it in that case



===== testing ====

To test this:

- set up a test-area, with two different repos

- create RepoA; create RepoA/.bashrc; symlink ~/.bashrc to /etc/bashrc; run deedot, and confirm it
  won't overwrite it

- remove the symlink that's currently at ~/.bashrc

- TODO: figure out something that lets us test whether two repos can co-exist by using the
  substitution method, and confirm that the correct source document gets substituted into the
  correct section

- create RepoB; create RepoB/.bashrc; create RepoA/.vimrc
    - confirm that .bashrc 
    > note...  is it possible to install this to somewhere other than $HOME?
    > for testing purposes, I suppose I could temporarily set $HOME to be another directory

- try removing RepoB completely
    - confirm that ~/.bashrc is removed
